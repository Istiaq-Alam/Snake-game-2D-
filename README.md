## Introduction

Welcome to Snake Game, a simple 2D snake game implemented in Java. This classic game allows players to control a snake with the objective of eating the red dot while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.

## Features

- **Simple and Intuitive Gameplay**: Easy-to-understand controls and gameplay mechanics suitable for players of all ages.
- **Dynamic Red Dot Generation**: The red dot (food) appears randomly on the game screen, providing a fresh challenge each time.
- **Scoring and Length Increase**: Each time the snake eats the red dot, the player's score increases, and the snake grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game window, displaying the final score and offering the option to restart.
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control the speed of the snake to customize the difficulty level according to your preference.
